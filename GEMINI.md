# Metabase Diagnostics Project

This document provides a starting point for Gemini to assist with the Metabase diagnostics project.

## 1. Project Overview

This project is focused on building a suite of diagnostic tools for troubleshooting Metabase instances. The primary goal is to create a set of command-line interface (CLI) tools using Babashka and Clojure to simplify and automate common diagnostic tasks.

## 2. Key Technologies

*   **Clojure:** The primary programming language for the diagnostic tools.
*   **Babashka:** A native Clojure scripting environment for creating fast-starting CLI tools.
*   **Docker:** Used to run multiple Metabase instances and other services for testing and diagnostics.

## 3. Project Goals

The main goals of this project are to:

*   Develop a set of reusable diagnostic tools for Metabase.
*   Create a streamlined workflow for troubleshooting common Metabase issues.
*   Leverage the power of Clojure and Babashka for efficient and effective diagnostics.
*   Maintain a well-documented and organized codebase.

## 4. Your Role as an AI Assistant

As an AI assistant, your role is to:

*   Assist in the development of the diagnostic tools by providing code examples, suggestions, and best practices.
*   Help with troubleshooting and debugging of the tools and the Metabase instances.
*   Provide information and guidance on Clojure, Babashka, and other related technologies.
*   Help maintain the project documentation and TODO lists.

## 5. Getting Started

Here are some initial questions you can ask to get started:

*   "What is the current status of the project?"
*   "What are the top priorities in the TODO list?"
*   "How can I help with the Babashka project setup?"
*   "Can you explain the architecture of the diagnostic tools?"
